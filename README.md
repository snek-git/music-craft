# Music Craft

Infinite Craft-style music discovery app. Combine genres and artists to discover new music at their intersection.

## How it works

- Drag genres/artists onto the canvas
- Bring two elements close together to combine them
- Genre + Genre = new Genre
- Genre + Artist = new Artist
- Artist + Artist = new Artist
- Click any artist to see their Last.fm info
